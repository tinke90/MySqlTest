## How did i came up with this idea?

```
 I was struggling my self with a home hosted MySql database server,
 the last time I checked the database connection was working just fine.
 But this time I was not able to connect and there was serveral things
 that I had in my mind but didn't know where to start. Couple days i tried
 several things and failed everytime.

 I couldn't solve the connection issue anyhow, so I started to wonder
 what I could possibly to do, what kind of application I will need.

 I got an idea and started to work with it.
```

## Usage:
 
 Enter required MySql information:
 `Host` `Port` `Database name` `Username` `Password`
and hit the Connect button, if connection was succesful, under the button will appear the green text

> Connection achieved...

If for one reason or another connection was not succeed, red text

> Connection was not reachable...

and possibly error will be provided in new window.

If any of the  input fields was left empty, front of the input field will appear a red star to
symbolize that user is required to fill the inputfield.

Symbols will disappear if any of the input fields was clicked.
